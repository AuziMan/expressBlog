# Welcome to Auzi's Blog Page! <br> This is a basic blog page using Node.JS and Express

### I got the boilerplate code from a youtube series found here: <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR1Zlu4u58g&t=879s <br> <br> I added my own featues and designs and will continue to make updates as I build my skills.

<br>

# Some key features I'd like to point out are:
- Integration with the Spotify API
    - I am able to show what song I am currently listening to, as well as display some of my favorite songs at the moment!
- Admin CRUD Operations
    - Currently, only I am able to create, edit, and delete blog posts. Down the road, I would like to allow any user to create and edit their own blog posts, essuntually turning this site into Reddits biggest competitor!

### Below are some screenshots directly from the page! <br> 
### NOTE: I will keep these screenshots as UTD as possible, but hopefully soon you will be able to take a look for yourself! Enjoy!

## Home Page (Top) 

### Here, I have my current landing page with a nav bar, an optional Light and Dark Mode toggle button, and a search button. 

#### Below, I have some pictures, but I plan to turn this into a carrosell of pictures. Still finalizing the home page design here at the top.

## Home Page (Middle) 

### As you scroll down, you are able to see some recent blog posts, organized by most recent. A user is able to click on each blog post to have a full-page view of the post! 

#### Eventually, I will introduce funtionality to attach a song of my choice to each blog post!

## Home Page (Bottom) 

### At the bottom of the page is my favorite feature, my 'Now Listening' section!

### This is a dynamic bubble that shows what song I am currently listening to. Because I was not listening to any songs at the moment, it shows 'No Track Currently Playing.'.

### As soon as I start playing a song on Spotify, the bubble will update to display the current track!

## Song Page


### The next page I have is my 'Songs' page! This page shows some of my favorite songs at the moment. 

### Each song card is a link to the specific song on Spotify.
